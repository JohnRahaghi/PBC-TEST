# Phase 1: Problem ID and Evaluation
### Instructions: The policy process begins with clearly identifying a problem or set of problems that may require a policy solution. Specific issues may come from any number of demand signals internal or external to OFCIO and OMB.  They need to be documented as a way to log a history of proposed initiatives, and to define the issue for action by the OFCIO.

This phase focuses on the problem itself, and not the solution. Define the issue as itâ€™s currently understood and what the implications are if it is not addressed. Evaluation of the problem should help determine its scope and how many end users (agencies, people, or both) are affected.
