# Phase 1: Problem ID and Evaluation
### Instructions: The policy process begins with clearly identifying a problem or set of problems that may require a policy solution. Specific issues may come from any number of demand signals internal or external to OFCIO and OMB.  Ideas need to be documented as a way to log a history of proposed initiatives, and to define the issue for action by the OFCIO.

The deliverable for this phase is designed for unit chiefs to make a decision whether to move forward and prioritize it for their team. This phase focuses on the problem itself, and not the solution. Define the issue as it’s currently understood and what the implications are if it is not addressed. Evaluation of the problem should help determine its scope and how many end users (agencies, people, or both) are affected. The Phase 1 deliverable is part of a close iterative process with Phase 2 that will further refine the definition.

Specific Deliverable:

A one pager that answers the following questions in one or two paragraphs:

•	Define the problem 

•	What will the proposed policy address?

•	How does it fit into OFCIO/individual team goals?

•	What evidence is there to warrant such a policy and how was it gathered (data, meetings, etc)?

•	What policies, laws, or statutes exist that relate to the above issue?

•	What is the timeline
