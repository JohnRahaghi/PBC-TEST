# Phase 2: Analysis and Stakeholder Engagement
### Instructions: This phase is intended to be highly iterative through stakeholder engagement to further refine the problem statement, scope, solutions, metrics, and timeline. The following deliverables will provide the basis for an evidence based approach to potential policy solutions.

####Specific Deliverables:
######Stakeholder Analysis: List and classify stakeholders that will be impacted by the policy or will have valuable input. (Consider internal OMB/Agency stakeholders and private sector groups and potential users as applicable. As information is gathered, update the Phase 1 problem ID as necessary.)
o	Document the plan for outreach (who on the team will reach out, dates of emails sent, phone calls made, when meetings are arranged, etc. An excel spreadsheet is helpful for both classifying stakeholders and logging outreach.)
•	Summary conclusions of outreach
o	Summarize the key takeaways after each meeting with stakeholders
o	After stakeholder interviews are completed, summarize all the common responses related to problem ID, obstacles, recommendations, solutions, KPIs, or any other similarities. If there are few common threads, summarize the common themes, problem assessments, and potential solutions.
•	Summary of research into the problem: Create a 1-3 page document with relevant citations on the particular problem that is being researched – (potential sources: github, gartner, librarians, google scholar, Bloomberg…)
